## C# Project to pass the subject

I could do what ever I wanted, so I created a game, something like the running dinosaur when you don't have the internet connection and using Google Chrome

It was created with the help of MS Forms where I "drew" all of the objects. The rest of it is just programming the logic and colliding mechanic as well as player score.
