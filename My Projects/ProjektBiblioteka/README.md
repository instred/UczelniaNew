## Object Oriented Python Project


I were given 3 projects to choose from and I thought this might be fun and also I'll learn the most of it.

The project involved creating a library management application based on CSV files (specified requirements). 
Program had to be implemented using an object-oriented approach.
The program includes several options, such as adding books, the ability to borrow and return books, and a history of all books and customers. 
Error handling is also included.
